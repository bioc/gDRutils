# gDRutils
A package with utility functions for dealing with munging and analyzing drug reponse data.

# General info
Its main responsibilities are:
- to provide getting/setting functionality for identifiers for downstream processing and analysis
- to provide convenience functions for switching between long and wide table formats
** Note that this could become obsolete as the gDR suite migrates to the BumpyMatrix.
